[mzML]
The <mzML> element and all content below may occur by itself in an XML document,
but is also designed to be wrapped in the mzML indexing schema in order to
facilitate random access within the file with appropriate reader software.

[cvList]
One of the <cv> elements in this list must be the PSI MS controlled vocabulary.
All <cvParam> elements in the document MUST refer to one of the <cv> elements
in this list.



[MISCpeaklist]
Peak lists are processed data from a mass spectrometry experiment. There can be 
multiple peak lists in an mzML file, which might be related via a separation, 
or just in sequence from an automated run. Any one peak list (mass spectrum) 
may also be composed of a number of acquisitions, which can be described 
individually herein.

[spectrum]
id's must be unique within a file. They may be LSIDs or simply the scan
number. scanNumbers must be unique within a file and must be monotonically
increasing throughout the file, although not necessarily sequentially.

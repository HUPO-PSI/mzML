 Adjustments for **raw** DIA data such as SONAR, HDMSE, or diaPASEF data:

| Workflow | Description | CV term set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MSE<br>AIF<br>p2cid | data independent acquisition from dissociation of full mass range | - data independent acquisition<br>- dissociation of full mass range |
| SONAR | data independent acquisition from dissociation of scanning quadrupole across mass range | - data independent acquisition<br>- dissociation of scanning quadrupole across a specified mass range |
| SWATH-MS<br>FT-ARM<br>HRM<br>PAcIFIC | data independent acquisition from dissociation of sequential mass ranges | - data independent acquisition<br>- dissociation of sequential mass ranges |
| diaPASEF | data independent acquisition from dissociation of sequential mass ranges separated by ion mobility | - data independent acquisition<br>- dissociation of sequential mass ranges<br>- ion mobility separation |
| HDMSE<br>IMS-AIF | data independent acquisition from dissociation of full mass range separated by ion mobility | - data independent acquisition<br>- dissociation of full mass range<br>- ion mobility separation |

Controlled Vocabulary changes
-----------------------------
- Ask all vendors to update the CV as relates to their products


Additional instance documents
-----------------------------
- Create one that demonstrates the use of the acquisitionList and acquisition (essentially, one precursor scan, three MS/MS scans, that are then combined)
- Create an example that shows a nice usage of CV in the 'sample' element (NEWT, Brenda, Cell Type Ontology, ...)
- Create one that demonstrates a MALDI run
- Create one that demonstrates a mzML file made from a list of dtas


Software implementations
------------------------
- Catalog and advertise all (pre-release) implementations of mzML format
